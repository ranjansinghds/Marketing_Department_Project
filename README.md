## 📊 Dataset

The dataset, `Marketing_data.csv`, includes information pertinent to marketing campaigns, such as:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer.
- **Spending Score**: Score assigned based on customer spending behavior.
- **Purchase History**: Record of past purchases made by the customer.
- **Campaign Response**: Customer's response to previous marketing campaigns.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranjansinghds/Marketing_Department_Project
cd Marketing_Department_Project
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed any missing data in the dataset.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical features such as `Gender` into numerical representations.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Visualized distributions** of key features to understand data patterns.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Grouped customers based on attributes like `Age`, `Income`, and `Spending Score` to identify distinct segments.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between different features to identify potential predictors of customer behavior.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**

- **Customer Segmentation**: Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their attributes.
- **Response Prediction**: Developed classification models to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
